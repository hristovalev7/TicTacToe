# Tic Tac Toe
This is a text-based Tic Tac Toe game where the bot makes decisions using the Minimax algorithm.
The bot is designed to punish the player by always making optimal moves, ensuring it wins as quickly as possible.
The game also features Alpha-Beta prunning, which eliminates unnecessary branches in the decision tree.
